## üìä Data Storage

### User Data (`users.json`)
```json
{
  "1": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "face_encoding": [...],
    "medicine_schedule": ["08:00", "20:00"],
    "last_medicine_time": "2024-01-15T08:05:00",
    "missed_doses": [...],
    "registration_date": "2024-01-01T10:00:00"
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not working**
   - Check camera permissions
   - Ensure no other application is using the camera
   - Try different camera index (change `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `cv2.VideoCapture(1)`)

2. **Voice recognition not working**
   - Install PyAudio: `pip install PyAudio`
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Ensure microphone is not muted

3. **Face recognition errors**
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Position face clearly in camera view
   - Check if face_recognition library is properly installed

4. **Medicine reminders not triggering**
   - Check system time is correct
   - Verify medicine schedule format (HH:MM)
   - Ensure BAYMAX is running continuously

### Performance Tips
- **Close unnecessary applications** to free up system resources
- **Good lighting** improves face recognition accuracy
- **Clear speech** enhances voice command recognition
- **Regular restarts** if running for extended periods
